#### Complexity Analysis:
The process of determining how efficient an algorithm is. Compexity analysis usually involves both the time complexity and the space complexity of an algorithm.
Complexity analysis is effectively used to determinate how "good" and algorithm is and whether is "better" then another one.

#### Time Complexity:
A measure of how fast an algrithm runs, time complexity in a central concept in the files of algorithms and in coding interviews.
It is expressed using Big O notation

#### Space Complexity:
A measure of how much auxiliary memory an aalgorithm takes up, space compexity is a central concept in the filed of algorithms and in coding interviews
It is expressed using Big O notation
